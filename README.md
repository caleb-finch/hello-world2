## I like lana del rey. My favorite album of her's is Norman Fucking Rockwell. It takes her typical melancholoy lyrics with her classic camp style of writing and adds beautiful piano ballads that create something more than the sum of its parts.

>We're getting high now because we're older
This is a quote off of Venice Bitch, which is my favorite song off the album.
